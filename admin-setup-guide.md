# Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

## How to Set Up Admin Access

### 1. Database Setup

First, run the updated database schema in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Add the is_admin column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### 2. Create Your First Admin User

In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Replace 'your-user-uuid-here' with your actual user ID from auth.users
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = TRUE 
WHERE id = 'your-user-uuid-here';
```

To find your user ID:
1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Users** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the UUID of your user account
3. Use that UUID in the SQL command above
